# Riccardo's 34 key keymap

## Objectives

- close as possible to the standard layout to minimize cognitive load for new users. Fingers tend to want to go to those positions naturally.
- logical layout e.g. numpad with operators close by
- used for:
  - normal typing
  - lots of programming (vscode/zed/helix)
  - lots of excel

## Layout

The starting point uses standard qwerty layout.

Homerow mods for modifiers

Symbol layer with a numpad on the right side of the keyboard

Navigation layer with inverted T arrow keys and function keys

## Alpha keys

Same format as standard keyboard

## Thumbs

Space and symbol layer (hold) on left thumb
Tab on other left them

Enter and navigation layer (hold) on right thumb
Backspace/delete on other right thumb

## Homerow mods

Similar order as standard keyboard.
Shift on pinky
Ctrl on ring finger
Alt on middle finger
Gui on index finger

## Symbol layer

Numpad on the right side of the keyboard together with +- \*/ \= close by

Symbols are behind the numbers so you can shift to get the symbols. These use the same symbols as the number row on a standard keyboard

Brackets are in a nice order on the left side

Other missing symbol keys are also added, such as programming & and |, " and ' and \_


## Navigation layer

Inverted T arrow keys
Home End Page Up and Page Down on right hand
Function keys on left hand

## Other additions

There is also a media layer and gaming layer which is sometimes used

Homerow mods make multiple mods shortcuts easier to press e.g. vscode CTRL+SHIFT+P or META+SHIFT+P; excel CTRL+SHIFT+7

ESCAPE is on j+k, or holding Q

CAPS_WORD is on l+;

DELETE is on SHIFT+BACKSPACE

There is a lock layer for numpad and symbol layer, by pressing Z+Layer, which locks you into the layer until you press the thumb next to the layer key. This allows for inputting numbers and navigating without holding layer key.

## One hand left / mouse mode

When using the mouse for scrolling, navigating, we can still use some typically used shortcuts with the left hand:

- hold Q for escape
- ctrl+c copy, ctrl+v paste, ctrl+z undo. Hence why ctrl is on the ring finger. We do sacrifice ctrl+x cut which is not used as much.
- alt+tab for switching windows
