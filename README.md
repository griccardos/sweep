# Riccardo's 34 key keymap

## Objectives

- close as possible to the standard layout to minimize cognitive load for new users. Fingers tend to want to go to those positions naturally.
- logical layout e.g. numpad with operators close by
- used for:
  - normal typing
  - lots of programming (vscode/zed/helix)
  - lots of excel

## Layout

The starting point uses standard qwerty layout.

Homerow mods for modifiers

Symbol layer with a numpad on the right side of the keyboard

Navigation layer with inverted T arrow keys and function keys

## Alpha keys

Same format as standard keyboard, with only exception of replacing /(?) with '(") which I use more often

## Thumbs

Space and symbol layer (hold) on left thumb
Tab on other left them

Enter and navigation layer (hold) on right thumb
Backspace/delete on other right thumb

## Homerow mods

Similar order as standard keyboard.
Shift on pinky
Ctrl on ring finger
Alt on middle finger
Gui on index finger

## Symbol layer

Numpad on the right side of the keyboard together with +-\*/= close by
Symbols are behind the numbers so you can shift to get the symbols
brackets are in a nice order on the left side
Few extras often used are also added, including the question mark which was moved

## Navigation layer

Inverted T arrow keys
Home End Page Up and Page Down on right hand
Function keys on left hand

## Other

There is also a media layer and gaming layer which is sometimes used

Homerow mods make multiple mods shortcuts easier to press e.g. vscode CTRL+SHIFT+P or META+SHIFT+P; excel CTRL+SHIFT+7

ESCAPE is on j+k

CAPS_WORD is on l+;

DELETE is on SHIFT+BACKSPACE
